copy of upstream's glog, but with optional support to build w/cmake

At some point it was the case that building this with cmake broke
some in-tree dependencies (they couldn't detect glog, probably)
but I had some projects that expected to be able to find
glog using cmake.

It would probably be easy to satisfy both needs :)
