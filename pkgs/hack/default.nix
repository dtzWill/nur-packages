      Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a workhorse face for
      code. It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and
      expands upon the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects.
      The face has been re-designed with a larger glyph set, modifications of
      the original glyph shapes, and meticulous attention to metrics.
